# CryptoStatList Web App - Front End

This is the Next.js front end for the CryptoStatList web app. It interacts with the Express.js GraphQL api found in [/server](../server/).

The application uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) for image hosting. Sign up for a free API account and preset.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling.

[Google ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) is used for bot detection. You will need to sign up and get some api keys.
